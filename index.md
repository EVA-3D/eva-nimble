# Nimble v2

![preview](assets/__ALL__.png)

Zesty Nimble v2 is one of the fancier options out there. Bowden system and direct drive combined to offer best of both worlds: lightness of a bowden and responsiveness of a direct drive. Not very popular choice. And due to high demand, very hard to get.

??? notice "MGN15"

    To mount EVA / Nimble v2 on a MGN15C carriage you will need a few different than the default parts and a few longer screws. The BOM replaces **only a few parts and screws** from the default BOM - for MGN15C you need to look at both - **what follows is not the full MGN15C BOM**.
